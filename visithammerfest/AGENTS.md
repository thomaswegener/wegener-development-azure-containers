# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/main.tsx` wires the React app into the DOM and applies global styles from `src/styles.css`.
- `src/App.tsx` holds the main page layout and components; add new screens or containers here or import child components from dedicated subfolders when you create them.
- `public/` stores static assets served at the root; favor this for favicons and SEO files.
- `dist/` is generated by builds; do not edit by hand. Keep images and other authored assets under `src` or `public`.
- `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig*.json` control bundling and TypeScript settings. Avoid editing `vite.config.d.ts` directly (generated).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Install deps: `npm install`.
- Run locally: `npm run dev` (Vite dev server with fast HMR).
- Production build: `npm run build` (TypeScript project build + Vite bundle to `dist/`).
- Preview built app: `npm run preview` (serves the `dist/` output).
- Lint placeholder: `npm run lint` currently just echoes a message; add ESLint/Prettier and update the script before relying on it.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript + React 18; prefer function components and hooks.
- Naming: PascalCase for components/files exporting components; camelCase for variables, functions, and hooks; SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for env-based constants.
- Imports: favor absolute paths only if configured; otherwise keep relative and tidy (group React, third-party, then local).
- Formatting: stick to consistent 2-space indentation and single quotes where possible; add Prettier/ESLint to enforce once chosen.
- CSS: shared styles live in `src/styles.css`; consider CSS Modules or component-scoped styles if the codebase grows.

## Testing Guidelines
- No test runner is configured yet; Vitest is typical with Vite/React if you add tests.
- Co-locate tests as `*.test.tsx` near the component or under `src/__tests__/`.
- Aim for coverage of rendering, props, and user flows; mock network calls and timers.
- Update this section with the chosen test command (e.g., `npm run test`) after setup.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: use concise, imperative subjects (e.g., `Add hero section layout`, `Fix build script`). Keep scope-focused.
- Before opening a PR: ensure `npm run build` and any added tests pass; include screenshots or GIFs for UI changes.
- PR description should summarize intent, list key changes, and note any follow-ups or known gaps; link issues when applicable.
- Keep diffs small and self-contained; prefer multiple focused PRs over a single broad one.

**Monorepo note:** This project lives inside the `containers` monorepo. Always commit and push from the monorepo root (`/home/wegener/containers`), not from within this subdirectory.
