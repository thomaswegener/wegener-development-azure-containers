Ever since we started the company, we have focused on long-term solutions in order to make a positive contribution to the environment and the local community, and to the greatest extent possible be self-sufficient both privately and in the company.\n\nOur company is certified as an Environmental Lighthouse, and stakeholders can contact us to receive our climate report by email. We work closely with environmental work both continuously in daily operations, and in fundamental planning and strategy work in the company.\n\nWe have particularly focused on these points of the UN's sustainability goals:\n\n3. Good health and well-being\n5. Gender equality\n8. Decent work and economic growth\n11. Sustainable cities and communities\n12. Responsible consumption and production\n\n3. By having good working conditions for us and our employees, we facilitate good health and quality of life. We actively involve our employees in shaping the working environment in which we work together.\n5. Equality between the genders, here all employees, regardless of gender, get equal tasks, equal responsibilities, and equal pay for equal work.\n8. Decent work and economic growth, we strive to offer good wages and give our employees good opportunities for a career, while at the same time we invest profits back into the company for further development. In addition, we have a strong focus on collaboration, both locally and regionally, in order to create better conditions for everyone, better experiences for guests, and better access to resources both now and in the future.\n11. We involve ourselves in the local community to build up a sustainable village, both by creating jobs in several arenas, we are co-owners of the project \"Porsangerfjorden Lodge\", which aims to create jobs, ensure continued operation of the school and kindergarten in the village, and facilitate entrepreneurs in the village.\n12. Responsible consumption and production, we try to be sensible in our purchases, repair what can be repaired, and feed the dog as correctly as possible so that we do not waste food. We also work closely with Gøran's company, Sledespesialisten, and try to use what is left over from sled production for useful things in the kennel, for example name tags for the dogs.\n\nOver time, we have also looked at the possibility of being able to produce our own dog food. Today, we have good access to meat from moose, sheep, and fish, which the dogs enjoy. And it can get even better as we develop the company.\n\nWe also have a strong focus on safety and first aid, both Mali and Gøran are trained in the Red Cross and Norway's Rescue Dogs, Gøran has also worked as a response manager and has several years of experience from the armed forces. We want all our guides to have a minimum of basic first aid, and then work on further training, focus on safety, and exercises, preferably in collaboration with other agencies.\n\nOut in nature, we mainly use established roads. Scooter and ATV trails that we help to maintain, and we work closely with the local cycling club to maintain common trails for fat bikes and dog teams.\n\nAnimal welfare is also very important, we have chosen to build our dog kennel in connection with the barn, so that all the dogs have their dog houses, inside the barn. They also have their own closed in yards on the outside so that they can freely go in and out as they wish. All dog yards, and dog houses, are built on even stricter requirements than what is set as of today, in order to be prepared for a future where the authorities also set stricter requirements for animal welfare. The dogs live together in pairs, and in addition to training on the team, we also have a large running yard for free play where they can run around and enjoy life. They get lots of cuddles and praise, attention, and training. The kennel is cleaned several times a day, and we use high-quality dog food, with a good variety and personal feeding for the best possible follow-up of each dog in the kennel.\n\nhttps://rapportering.miljofyrtarn.no/stats/170393"

      guides: {
        emilie: `My adventure at Pirate Husky began in 2023. I had the opportunity to do an internship abroad as part of my tourism studies in France. I had always dreamed of traveling to the far North and working in a sled dog company. I came to Pirate Husky and fell in love with Norway and the huskies. That’s the reason why, after completing my studies, I decided to come back here. I work here now as the department manager for Børselv, guiding, taking care of the dogs, assisting with organizing activities, staff and bookings.`,

        janne: `Even if I’m originally from Germany, I grew up with a lot of outdoor sports and expeditions in the arctic. Since I was a small kid, I’ve been interested in dogsledding and dreaming of becoming a musher. After I moved to Norway, I got my first dog from Pirate Husky, and ended up not only working here as a guide and handler, but moving in with Mali, Gøran and the kids as a part of the family. I’m also the right hand of Mali, helping with bookings and other when it's too much to do in the office. I guide in both German, English and Norwegian.`,

        laila: `I study forensic chemistry in Germany, and for about six months each year, I escape university life to visit my boyfriend Jakob, our dog Talvi, and Pirate Husky. I love everything about it – the winter, the huskies, guiding tours, and meeting people from all over the world. I guide in Hammerfest, and in German, English and Norwegian.`,

        jakob: `Ever since I was young, my family and I often travelled from Germany to Sweden for holidays. After finishing school, I even spent a year living there to work with dogsledding. From an early age, I knew that if I ever moved abroad, it would be to a northern country. That’s how I eventually found my way to Hammerfest and Pirate Husky. Now, Talvi, my dog and I handle most of the tours that take place here, sharing the beauty of the North with visitors. I’m the department manager of Hammerfest branch, and guides in German, English, and sometimes try a little Norwegian.`,

        jamie: `I work as a handler for Pirate Husky for a year, my daily job is caring about the dogs and train them, but I’m also the “everything” guy, helping not only with the dogs, but in all practical challenges in the farm and the kennel, giving me a lot of variation in the job. I am from South Germany and worked in the machine building industry but got tired from only working in a factory every day. Jonathan is an old childhood friend of mine; he told me about the job and that’s how I ended up here. I love working with the dogs, the outdoors, and the variation.`,

        jonathan: `Hey, my name is Jonathan. I am an adventure guy and like to be and work outside. I moved and started to work here because I really love dogs and was looking for a big new adventure. I started as a handler, taking care of the dogs and help sometimes out as a guide. Now I am the technical responsible guide, so I get to do a lot of different work as well as guiding. After I moved here, I met the love of my life and started a family. I am the right hand of Gøran and help him with everything around the kennel and the farm. I guide in German, English, and started now also in Norwegian.`
