                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Book Finnmark AS is responsible for forwarding your booking to the relevant supplier. It is the supplier’s responsibility to provide the activity, rental equipment or accommodation in line with your booking. We will ensure you receive relevant information before your arrival / tour, and will contact you in the event of any major changes or cancellation of your booking. The agreement may apply to an activity, accommodation, product, service or a combination of these.
<br>
<br>Your booking is confirmed when you receive a confirmation e-mail with a booking reference number. We recommend our guests to print this confirmation and bring it along on your journey. You may also show the confirmation electronically on your tablet or mobile. A minimum age of 18 applies to make a booking through Book Finnmark. It is also possible to book by phone or e-mail, but a service charge per booking applies. If you need to contact your supplier before, during or after your arrival date you will find contact information on the booking confirmation or on the suppliers's website. You can also contact Book Finnmark by e-mail: booking@bookfinnmark.com
<br>Payment and security
<br>The payment is processed at the time of booking. Book Finnmark is responsible for the actual transaction, and for ensuring that the correct amount is charged to your card. We will contact you in the event of problems with your credit card. If we are unable to make contact, your booking will be cancelled. All personal data and credit card information is handled on an encrypted site, so all information provided is secure. Only Book Finnmark and the supplier of the relevant product will have access to your name and contact details. This information will be used to process your booking.
<br>
<br><strong>Cancellation / changes by the guest 
<br></strong>To cancel or change your booking, please contact Book Finnmark. All cancellations must be sent by e-mail to booking@bookfinnmark.com
<br>For cancellations less than 7 days prior to arrival, please contact both the supplier and Book Finnmark.
<br>
<br>Book Finnmark has no control over the exchange rate that will be calculated for refunds to credit cards and is not responsible for any loss incurred due to fluctuations in currency. Please note that booking fees and credit card fees are non-refundable. Cancellation of an existing booking may be subject to an administration fee charged by us or a supplier. Some of our suppliers and partners operate with different cancellation terms in addition to ours, such as airlines and rental companies. You will be informed of regulations when ordering from these suppliers. Please note that Book Finnmark does not pay any bank fees incurred for international transfers. This fee will be deducted from the refund.
<br>
<br>The following cancellation fees / deadlines apply:
<br>
<br>A full refund is provided for cancellations made more than 7 days prior to the arrival date / tour date
<br>No refund is provided for cancellations made less than 7 days prior to the arrival date / tour date
<br>Any changes made by the guest are regarded as a cancellation.
<br>
<br>Some suppliers and partners have other terms of cancellation than those mentioned above. This applies particularly to the booking of airline tickets, accommodation and rental cars. In such cases, the terms and conditions will be displayed on the checkout page or in the product description at the time of booking.
<br>
<br><strong>Special conditions for booking of accommodation: 
<br></strong>Check-in and check-out: The check-in time is 15.00 (3pm) on the arrival date. The room must be vacated by 12.00 on the departure date. The room is reserved until 18.00 (6pm) on the arrival date. If you plan to arrive later, you must notify the accommodation provider in advance.
<br>Liability for damages: The guest, or the guarantor for the room/apartment/cabin, is liable for any damages resulting from negligent or reckless behaviour by the guests.
<br>Insurance/cancellation protection
<br>We recommend all our guests to ensure they have good insurance before commencing their trip in case of illness, lost luggage, accident, liability, etc.
<br>
<br><strong>Our suppliers
<br></strong>We are responsible for our suppliers getting paid for what you have ordered through us. Our suppliers are responsible for carrying out your booking in accordance with applicable laws and regulations that apply to the supplier, including that the supplier has the necessary insurance, permits, equipment, staffing, etc.
<br>
<br>Cancellations/major changes from our side
<br>Cancellations or major changes may occur due to:
<br>
<br>Conditions that are beyond our or our supplier’s control, e.g. weather, accidents/breakdowns, strikes etc.
<br>Conditions for the booking not being met, e.g. minimum number of participants. A minimum of two full-priced participants applies for most trips, but this may increase to a minimum of six full-priced participants for certain tours including boat or transportation.
<br>
<br>If such cancellation or major change occurs, and you do not accept the alternative provided, we will give a full refund. However, in order to give you the best possible experience, we reserve the right to make minor adjustments in the arrangements from the supplier. Such adjustments may occur due to closed roads, weather, snow or other conditions of nature. Please note that Book Finnmark has no control over the exchange rate calculated by refund to credit cards and is not responsible for any loss due to currency conversions. Also note that Book Finnmark does not pay any bank fees incurred for international transfers, and that such fees are deducted from the amount to be refunded. Credit card fees are non-refundable.
